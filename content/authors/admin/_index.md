## About Me

**Yuhang Tian** earned his bachelor's degree in Telecommunications Engineering from Beijing Jiaotong University
    and a joint bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Lancaster University, China, in 2020.
In 2022, he graduated cum laude with a master's degree in Embedded Systems from the Cybersecurity group at TU Delft, Netherlands.
His master's thesis focused on developing a framework for confidential and privacy-preserving neural network training, addressing challenges posed by a *malicious minority*.
The framework enables both the server and clients to obtain a robustly trained model without centralizing data storage.
From 2022 to 2023, Yuhang worked as a security researcher at NSFOCUS, a security solution provider,
    where he contributed to the development of a privacy-preserving computing platform tailored for medical and educational applications.
His research interests include privacy-preserving data sharing, software development, and machine learning/deep learning.
