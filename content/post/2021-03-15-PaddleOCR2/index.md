## Abstract

This essay is going to research PaddleOCR from the perspective of its architecture. We first derive its architecture style - pipe-and-filter and blackboard patterns from its working mechanism. Then we illustrate the containers and components to describe their structure. Furthermore, we analyze PaddleOCR from development and run-time views. At last, we simply show some API design principles that PaddleOCR applies. PaddleOCRâ€™s Architectural Style Trade-off! The Tricky Architecture Architecture Structure Design Development View Runtime.
