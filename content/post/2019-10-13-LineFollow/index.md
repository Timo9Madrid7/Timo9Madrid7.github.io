## Abstract

This paper presents a low-cost scheme for developing an Arduino robotic car with varying functions, including line following, ultrasonic navigation, and automatic parking. In terms of line following, an array of IR reflective sensors, distinguishing the binary colors, can be used for tracking the lines, in addition, the speed of the car can be adjusted by a closed-loop PID controller. The speed of both wheels can be measured by Hall elements or raster. Turning to ultrasonic navigation, an ultrasonic sender can lead the car with two corresponding receivers to the location. The variance between the ultrasonic receivers can determine the moving direction. For automatic parking process, a combination of ultrasonic sensors and IR reflective sensors, respectively used for detecting the distance and parking line, can detect the final parking area. This multifunctional robot can be used for human assistance purposes, indoor deliver services, etc.
